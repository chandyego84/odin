    <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon yellow or white miso paste</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
</ul>
<h4>For the tofu stir fry:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli, stem on (about 3 large heads or 6 heaping cups florets)*</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper (or half red and half orange)</li>
    <li>4 ounces shiitake mushrooms (optional)</li>
    <li>2 green onions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>14-ounces firm or extra firm tofu</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil, divided</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Sesame seeds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start the rice: If serving with rice, start the rice.</li>
    <li>Make the sauce: Whisk together the stir fry sauce ingredients in a medium bowl, or make the sauce in advance and refrigerate until cooking.</li>
    <li>Chop the veggies: Chop the broccoli into florets. Thinly slice the pepper. Remove the shiitake stems and thinly slice them, if using. Thinly slice the green onion. Peel and grate the ginger.</li>
    <li>Cook the tofu: Cut the tofu into bite sized pieces (1-inch squares, 3/8-inch thick and pat it dry with a towel. Add 2 tablespoons sesame oil to a large non-stick pan and add the tofu cubes and a few pinches kosher salt. Turn on the heat to medium-high. Cook 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned on the bottom.</li>
    <li>Flip the tofu: Briefly remove the pan from the heat to reduce spitting. Flip the tofu with chopsticks (the easiest method!) or tongs. Return the heat to medium-high and cook 5 to 6 minutes until browned. Remove the tofu to a bowl and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Stir fry the veggies: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add the broccoli, pepper, and shiitake mushrooms and two pinches salt and cook 6 to 7 minutes until just starting to brown on edges, stirring occasionally. In the last minute, add 1 tablespoon water and allow the vegetables to steam.</li>
    <li>Turn down the heat to low. Add the green onion and ginger and cook 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Add the tofu and sauce and stir until the sauce thickens. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired. Serve immediately. Store leftovers up to 3 days refrigerated.</li>
